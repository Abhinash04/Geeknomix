                <h4><strong>1. INFORMATION COVERED BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h4>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of our Platform’s functionality may be used without
                        revealing any personal information, though for features or services related to the
                        Tracks/Courses, personal information is required. If you do not use these specific features
                        or services on the Platform, then the only information we collect will be “Non-Personal
                        Information” (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify you). Non-Personal
                        Information includes information like the web pages that you have viewed. In order to access
                        certain features and benefits on our Platform, you may need to submit “Personally
                        Identifiable Information” (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally
                        Identifiable Information can include, but not be limited to, information such as your name,
                        email address, contact number (cellular and landline), educational qualification(s), Aadhaar
                        number, PAN, social security and tax identification numbers, and post-qualification or work
                        experience among other things. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the
                        Personally Identifiable Information you submit to Geeknomix. Inaccurate information may
                        affect your ability to use the Platform, the information you receive when using the
                        Platform, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address and contact number
                        should be kept valid because these are the primary channels through which we communicate
                        with you.</span></p>
                <h4><strong>2. INFORMATION COLLECTION</strong></h4>
                <p><strong><br></strong><strong>NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><strong><br></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you come to our Platform, we may track, collect and aggregate
                        Non-Personal Information indicating, among other things, which pages of our Platform were
                        visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks
                        were “clicked.” We also collect information from the URLs through which you connected with
                        our Platform. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating
                        system and browser software used by each user of the Platform. Although such information may
                        not be considered Personally Identifiable Information, based on local laws, we may be able
                        to determine a user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her
                        point of connectivity from an IP address. We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information
                        from the Platform visitors to track the total number of visitors on the Platform in
                        aggregate form and to identify the type of Internet web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer®)
                        and operating system (e.g., Windows®) used by them. This information allows us to
                        continuously improve our Platform and services.</span></p>
                <p><strong>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</strong><strong><br></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Identifiable Information, you share with Geeknomix
                        shall have a meaning derived from the definition of ‘Personal Information’ or ‘Personal
                        Data’ as per respective Data Protection Laws applicable to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information provided by you is used only in accordance with
                        the purpose described in the Policy. We collect through our Platform, or through third-party
                        platforms being used by us, the information that you provide to us when you sign up for
                        information updates or Tracks, participate in our public forums, avail our chat room
                        services, send you emails, call you, participate in online or offline events, and/or receive
                        other services on or through our Platform or through any of Geeknomix’s or its Educational
                        Partners’ offline activities. This information may include, among other things, your name,
                        postal address, email address, contact number, social security or tax identification
                        numbers, login credentials (in the case of registered users), educational qualification(s),
                        salary information, working goals, post-qualification experience, and photographs. We
                        collect demographic information such as your gender, socio-economic status, and other
                        similar personal information. In the case of scholarships, refunds or referrals, we will
                        collect your bank account information. Other than this, we do not collect any of your
                        financial information, and all payments are processed by third-party payment gateway
                        providers.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect this information in a number of ways, including when
                        you enter it while using our Platform, interact with our customer support, or participate in
                        our surveys, or marketing promotions.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geeknomix, or its Educational Partners and third-party service
                        providers, may, for instance, collect certain information from you in conjunction with
                        assignments, exams and other assessments related to the online course. For example, as part
                        of a proctored exam for a course, Geeknomix (or its third-party service providers) may
                        collect certain Personally Identifiable Information from you in order to (a) verify or
                        authenticate your identity or submissions made by you, such as a signature for a test or an
                        assignment log, a photograph or a recording of you (e.g., using a webcam) or information
                        included on a photo identification card or document, or (b) monitor your performance during
                        an exam to confirm that you are abiding by the applicable test rules or requirements (e.g.,
                        confirming that you are not using prohibited resources). Geeknomix may also collect
                        information from you or about your performance or your accomplishments, such as quiz/exam
                        scores, grades, project evaluations, teacher evaluations and other evaluations of your
                        performance or accomplishments.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you need any financial assistance, Geeknomix may
                        recommend certain third-party credit facility providers. Should you opt to sign up with such
                        credit facility providers, any information you provide to them will be governed by their
                        terms of use and policies, as you would be their direct customer. Please note, Geeknomix
                        does not control, manage or regulate such third-party providers.</span></p>

                        information is collected using a pixel tag, which is an industry standard technology used by
                        most major websites. Such third parties are not permitted by Geeknomix to sell or share

                        communicate about its Services, Platform and other information. We may, from time to time,
                        use business partners, operational service providers and subcontractors ("Service
                        Providers") to operate and provide our services to Users and to comply with legal and
                        regulatory requirements. As necessary under this Privacy Policy, our Service Providers are
                        required to protect the information we provide them in a manner that is consistent with this

                        may not have control on their privacy practices.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use your information for managing and processing purposes,
                        including, but not limited to, tracking attendance, progress and completion of a
                        Track/Courses. As part of our management and processing of the Track/Courses, we will use
                        certain Personally Identifiable Information to administer exams, projects, and other
                        assessments for the Track. For example, as part of an exam, Geeknomix may use certain
                        information collected from you in order to verify your identity or to monitor your
                        performance during the exam to confirm that you are abiding by the applicable testing rules
                        or requirements.</span></p>

                        provide such services to you and for quality control purposes, and we may also archive this
                        information and/or use it for future communications with you. For example, Geeknomix may
                        make available to you chat room services that allow you to communicate with Geeknomix’s
                        staff members or your peers in the same cohort, and we may use and share your Personally
                        Identifiable Information to provide these services to you. In another example, Geeknomix’s
                        staff members may create groups on WhatsApp (or similar service providers) with other
                        students and make you a member of such a group. These groups may be used to provide services
                        in conjunction with the Tracks, including, but not limited to, updates related to the
                        Tracks, details of potential employers, etc. Please be aware that the information disclosed
                        on a third-party service provider’s platform will be dependent and subject to such
                        third-party’s privacy policies and/or on your settings regarding what information you have
                        consented to share with them. Geeknomix and/or its associates shall have no liability in
                        this regard whatsoever.</span></p>

                        establish a membership to participate in digital wallets, payment services or rewards
                        programs. If you elect to do so, we will disclose to such companies your information that is

                        responsible for the privacy practices of the companies sponsoring these membership programs,
                        and we suggest you review the individual privacy policies of each company with whom you
                        establish such memberships. Billing information may be archived by us or our providers. We
                        may archive Personally Identifiable Information other than billing information and/or use it
                        for future communications with you.</span></p>

                        surveyors), may approach you to understand the impact of our Tracks on your careers. For
                        this purpose, we may connect with you via a phone call, email you questionnaires, or request
                        you to attend workshops.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use Non-Personal Information in aggregate form to build
                        higher-quality, more useful services by performing statistical analysis of the collective
                        characteristics and behaviour of our Users and by measuring demographics and interests

                        be assessing your performance; or mentors who will be supporting students. For example, if
                        you are taking a Track through a university, we may share Personally Identifiable
                        Information about you and your performance with the university to report on your progress in
                        the Track and to enable them to issue a certificate to you on completion of the Track.
                        Information shared with our Educational Partners will be subject to the privacy policies and
                        procedures of such partners. Also, we may archive this information and/or use it for future
