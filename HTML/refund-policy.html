                    otherwise expressly agreed in writing by Geeknomix, full payment for participation in a Track is
                    required at the time of registration. In the case of Tracks that include a trial window, such trial
                    window shall be made available only after the full payment. During the trial window, upon a request
                    by the student, and to the satisfaction of Geeknomix, Geeknomix may choose to refund the Track
                    Fees paid, subject to deduction of such applicable charges as may be decided by Geeknomix from
                    time to time. Once the trial window is closed, there will be no refund allowed for any reason
                    whatsoever. Unless explicitly specified on the website as a part of an offer or otherwise, the trial
                    window will be of 7 days from the date of enrollment.<br><br>It is the sole responsibility of the
                    user enrolling into a Track to check the accuracy of, and evaluate the suitability and relevance of,
                    the Track selected. The enrolment into a Track is non-transferable.<br><br>To make payment for any
                    Track or to purchase any services or products offered by Geeknomix through the Platform, you must
                    have internet access and a current valid accepted payment method as indicated during sign-up
                    ("Payment Method"). Geeknomix does not store any of your credit card information or such other
                    information restricted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for processing payment and has partnered
                    with payment gateways for the payment towards the services. By using a third-party payment provider,
                    you agree to abide by the terms of such a payment provider. You agree that in case Geeknomix’s
                    third-party payment provider stores any such information, Geeknomix will not be responsible for
                    such storage, and it will be solely at your discretion to allow the third party to store such
                    information. Any loss of such information or any loss incurred by you due to the usage of such
                    information will be solely a loss incurred by you, and Geeknomix is in no way liable for any such
                    losses and is neither responsible to reimburse/make good such losses in any manner whatsoever. You
                    also agree to pay the applicable fees for the payments made through the Platform.<br><br>Failure to
                    pay the applicable Track fee may result in the withdrawal of your access to a Track. Depending on
                    where you transact with us, the type of payment method used, and where your payment was issued, your
                    transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or exchange rates. Geeknomix does not
                    support all payment methods, currencies, or locations for payment. All applicable taxes are
                    calculated based on the billing information you provide to us at the time of enrolment/purchase.
